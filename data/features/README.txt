FEATURE DATA - IMPORTANT NOTES
==============================

1. TIMESTAMP CONVENTION
   Timestamps indicate when the 3-minute measurement period STARTED.

   Example:
   - Row with datetime 12:00:00 contains data for the period 12:00:00 - 12:03:00
   - This data becomes available at 12:03:00

2. DEDUPLICATION
   The legacy scraping system captured data every ~20 seconds, but values
   only update every 3 minutes. Duplicate scrapes have been removed -
   only the first occurrence of each new value is kept.

3. OUTLIER REMOVAL
   Regulation values with |value| > 300 MW are removed as data errors.
   (Same threshold used for imbalance label)

4. FILES
   - regulation_3min.csv: Regulation electricity (MW) - inverse of imbalance
   - load_3min.csv: System load (MW)
   - production_3min.csv: System production (MW)
   - export_import_3min.csv: Export/Import balance (MW)

5. DATE RANGES
   - Regulation & Load: 2024-01-01 to 2026-01-25 (full coverage)
   - Production & Export/Import: 2025-10-08 to 2026-01-25 (limited)
